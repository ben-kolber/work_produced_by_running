Total work generated by a human when running based on a paper by Patrick A Willems and Giovanni Alfredo Cavagna

## Idea
A recent new phenomenon in the world of running is the measurement of 'power' generated during a run. In physics, it is more commong to refer to this as work done while running. 
In order to get an accurate estimation, one must look at this problem in a bit more complexity than a basic kinematics problem. 
During running, our body is oscilating up and down as our legs and arms. Using this idea, we can think of each joint as a center mass, and calculate the work it does during oscilation. The other non- joint center mass in the pelvis. 

This algorithm calcuates the work done during a run given the height, weights, run- time, distance, gradient and velocity of a run. This was done as a favor for a friend who runs a startup AI personal trainer, and wanted another metric to produce for the runner.
